# Subnautica Modding Nautilus CLA

This Contributor License Agreement (CLA) must be signed by any individual who wishes to contribute to the Nautilus API after June 20th, 2023. Given the challenges in obtaining approvals from all current and previous contributors for project-wide decisions, this agreement has become a necessity.

In the context of this document, "you" refers to the contributor and "we" refers to the Subnautica Modding organization (<https://github.com/SubnauticaModding>).  A "contribution" is defined as any act of merging a contributor's work into this repository.

**By signing this CLA, you agree to be bound by the following statements, which apply to all current, previous, and future versions of the Nautilus API, and will remain in effect until this CLA is terminated or superseded**:

1. You grant the Subnautica Modding organization a non-exclusive, irrevocable, and transferable license to use, copy, prepare derivatives, distribute, and display your contribution on any licensing terms.
2. You also grant permission to the Subnautica Modding organization to make a fair license change without your approval. A "fair license change" will not have the intent to forbid future contributions or derivative works. A license change may occur following the unanimous decision of all maintainers, which includes anyone who has write access to the repository at the time of making the decision, but also requires the permission of all previous contributors who did not sign this CLA.

It is important to note that the Subnautica Modding organization will NEVER sell, commercialize, or otherwise restrict the open-source status of Nautilus.

If you have contributed to Nautilus in the past, you are not bound by the aforementioned statements until signing. However, you may be required to sign the CLA before future PRs are accepted. Please note that signing this CLA will affect all prior, current, and future contributions.
