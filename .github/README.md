## Contributing
We would love to have people contribute to SMLHelper.  
To get started, first fork the repo and then clone it to your local environment.  

- As of version 2.1, SMLHelper has been updated to use Harmony version 1.2.0.1.

- As of version 2.2, SMLHelper is now using the _publicized_ versions of `Assembly-CSharp.dll` and `Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll` (the originals being located in your `Subnautica_Data/Managed` folder).  
To create your own publiciezed DLLs, you will need to download or compile the [Assembly Publicizer](https://github.com/CabbageCrow/AssemblyPublicizer/releases) and follow the [instructions](https://github.com/CabbageCrow/AssemblyPublicizer/blob/master/README.md) to convert the original DLLs into `Assembly-CSharp_publicized.dll` and `Assembly-CSharp-firstpass_publicized.dll`.  
You will need to copy these DLLs into the `Dependencies` folder of the solution before you can build it.

Then, load up the solution, make your edits, then create your Pull Request!
