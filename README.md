# SMLHelper
A complete library that helps you out on your Subnautica modding adventures by making adding new items, models, sprites a LOT easier. Check out the wiki page.

# Contributing
We would love to have people contribute to SMLHelper. To get started, first fork the repo and then clone it, and then copy Assembly-CSharp.dll and Assembly-CSharp-firstpass.dll (located in your Subnautica_Data/Managed folder) to the Dependencies folder. Then, load up the solution, make your edits and PR them!
